This is an implementation of an Ant Colony Optimization Algrorithm (AS) that solves the Minimum Energy Broadcast Problem (MEBP).
It was written as an exam for "heuristische optimierungsverfahren" at the technical university of vienna.

The Project can be build with maven2, using the command 

mvn clean install

This will result in a executable jar file which takes a file containing an MEBP problem and then logs out steps to solve it. You can find examples of MEBP problem files in the MEBP folder.
